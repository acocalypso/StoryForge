# Database Migration Strategy - Data Preservation

## Problem Solved
**CRITICAL FIX**: Removed `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` which was causing user data loss during database schema updates.

## Current Implementation

### Safe Migration Approach
- ✅ **Proper Migration Paths**: All schema changes now use proper Room migrations
- ✅ **Data Preservation**: User books, chapters, and progress are preserved during updates
- ✅ **Transactional Safety**: Migrations use database transactions for atomic operations
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Failed migrations throw meaningful errors instead of silently deleting data

### Migration Coverage
```kotlin
MIGRATION_1_2: Legacy compatibility
MIGRATION_2_3: Enhanced metadata support  
MIGRATION_3_4: Chapter content field addition
MIGRATION_4_5: Chapter backup system
MIGRATION_5_6: Future-proofing placeholder
```

### Database Versions
- **Current Version**: 5
- **Migration Path**: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → (6 ready)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full coverage from version 1

## For Future Developers

### Adding New Migrations
1. **Never use `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`** - This deletes user data!
2. **Always increment database version** in `@Database` annotation
3. **Create proper Migration object** in `DatabaseMigrations.kt`
4. **Add migration to both**:
   - `DatabaseModule.kt` (Hilt-managed instance)
   - `StoryForgeDatabase.kt` (Companion object instance)

### Example Safe Migration
```kotlin
val MIGRATION_X_Y = object : Migration(X, Y) {
    override fun migrate(database: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
        database.beginTransaction()
        try {
            // Your migration SQL here
            database.execSQL("ALTER TABLE...")
            database.setTransactionSuccessful()
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            throw IllegalStateException("Migration failed: ${e.message}", e)
        } finally {
            database.endTransaction()
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing Migrations
1. Install app with older database version
2. Add some test data (books, chapters)
3. Update app with new database version
4. Verify all data is preserved
5. Check that new features work correctly

## User Impact
- ✅ **No More Data Loss**: Books and chapters survive app updates
- ✅ **Seamless Updates**: Users won't notice schema changes
- ✅ **Progress Preservation**: Writing progress and backups maintained
- ✅ **Trust Building**: Users can confidently update the app

## Emergency Recovery
If a migration fails:
1. Error is logged with details
2. App shows user-friendly error message
3. Data remains in previous state (not deleted)
4. User can contact support with specific error info

## Monitoring
- All migration errors are logged
- Migration success/failure can be tracked
- Database version is recorded for debugging
