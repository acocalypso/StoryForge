# PDF Export Enhancement Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### Enhanced PDF Structure
We have successfully implemented a new PDF structure with the following layout:
- **Page 1**: Book cover (if available) or placeholder
- **Page 2**: Title page with book title, author, and metadata

- **Page 4+**: Chapter content with professional formatting

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Cover Page Rendering
- Added `loadCoverImage()` method to load cover images from file paths

## 🔧 HOW TO TEST

### Using the App Interface

1. **Install the App** (✅ Completed)
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Aco\Desktop\Android-Dev\StoryForge"
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

2. **Test Book Export with Cover**
   - Open the StoryForge app
   - Navigate to a book with chapters
   - Set a cover image for the book (optional)
   - Tap the export menu/button
   - Select "PDF Document (.pdf)" format
   - Export the book
   - Check the generated PDF:
     * Page 1: Cover image or placeholder
     * Page 2: Title page with book info
     * Page 3: Table of contents
     * Page 4+: Chapter content

3. **Test Single Chapter Export**
   - Open a chapter for editing
   - Use the export option
   - Select PDF format
   - The PDF should start with chapter content (no cover/title pages)
